Biodiversity Intactness Index change in Phoenix subdivision
Context
In 2021, Maricopa County, which encompasses the Phoenix metropolitan area, was the US county that added the most developed land since 2001 [1]. Urban sprawl creates pressure on biodiversity and natural areas. In this task you will explore a dataset showing values for a biodiversity intactness index (BII) [2, 3] to find changes in this BII around the Phoenix area from 2017 to 2020.

Highlights of analysis:
Data wrangling and exploration
Geospatial data wrangling
Creating and customizing a map
